-- Healer, Healer --

Welcome to the holy land of Ludistan: city of vagrants, city of exiles, city of saints and martyrs.
This ground has housed and cradled many a religion in its term, many of which have crossed paths
with something less than warmth. The history of Ludistan is one etched in blood - Holy War and persecution
have torn the place at the seams for centuries. The restless dead below, those swaths of the damned, still
haunt this site of pilgrimmage and supposed sanctuary. The weak of soul and weak of will who arrive with
pure intentions perish at the influence of these horrid wraiths. The only respite from these spirits'
terrible afflictions is in the city healer, a figure of great renown to the townsfolk.

The role of healer is now yours. Cure quickly, and cure relentlessly. How many will you save?


-- Instructions --

Heal patients by mixing together the remedies needed to treat their ailments. Click on an ingredient to
add it to the cauldron. Click "Treat" to mix the ingredients and treat the patient with your concoction.
You will have 2 minutes each day to save as many patients as you can. Consult the Grimoire often; it will
tell you everything you need to know.
